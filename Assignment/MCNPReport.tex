\section{Exercise 1 Simple Neutron Source in a Bucket of Water}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Include screencap of each cell's number and material
	\item show, in the 2nd graphic, that as we move up the bucket there is a void appearing.
\end{itemize}
\section{Exercise 3: Criticality}
\subsection{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Examine and report upon the estimate of $k_{eff}$ with cycle number given in the output.
	\item Are you confident in the final reported result and its uncertainty? Justify your answer.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item make sure that the 10 statistical checks pass on all cells
	\end{itemize}
	\item In addition to Monte Carlo stochastic uncertainties what other uncertainties may need 
	to be considered in a criticality safety assessment?
\end{itemize}
