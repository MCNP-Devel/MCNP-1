1. Make the input file
2. See the first 50, if they are sensible or not.
3. For the tex file: I wanted to make all sections' title (including but not limited to: "\section", "\includegraphics{geometry used}", "\subsection{questions}") and then make sure to include two horizontal cross sections, 1 above the water level, 1 below.

Things to consider:
Apparently table 161 and 162 has unormalized tally as their abscissa; 161 is simply a (log-x and log-y) histogram of the tallies stored; each tally is stored as its full energy.
Useful quantity unique to table 160:
	(largest  tally)/(average (non-zero) tally)
	(confidence interval shift)/mean
